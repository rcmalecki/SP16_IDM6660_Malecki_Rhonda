			<article>
			
				<img src="images/centralpark.jpg" alt="Central Park">
				
				<h2>Central Park</h2>
				
				<p>Rain or shine, <a href="http://www.centralparknyc.org/?referrer=https://www.google.com/" 
				target="_blank">Central Park</a> is a must-see. It's a beautiful escape from the craziness 
				of the city, perfect for long walks, row boating, people watching, picnicking, enjoying world 
				class street musicians, and so much more.</p> 

				<p><span>Extra</span> A few blocks south of the park, there's this great little French restaurant 
				called <a href="http://labonnesoupe.com/" target="_blank">Le Bonne Soupe</a>. This local favorite 
				is one of the few restaurants that hasn't come and gone over the years, and if you eat there, 
				you'll understand why.</p>

				<img src="images/met.jpg" alt="Metropolitan Museum of Art">
			
				<h2>Metropolitan Museum of Art</h2>
				
				<p>Right along the eastern side of Central Park, you'll find the <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/" 
				target="_blank">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>. In my opinion, this historical art museum is right up 
				there with London's National Gallery and the Louvre in Paris - in other words, not to be missed.</p>

				<p><span>Extra</span> While the MET's collections are outstanding, their cafe is ridiculously overpriced. 
				I recommend saving your money and eating elsewhere.</p>

			<article>
			
				<img src="images/freedomtower.jpg" alt="World Trade Center Site">
				
				<h2>Lower Manhattan</h2>
				
				<p>Visit lower Manhattan. It's a bit businessy, maybe even touristy, but dig a little deeper and you'll find
				a whole lot of history, including <a href="https://www.nps.gov/cacl/index.htm" target="_blank">Castle Clinton</a>, 
				<a href="https://www.trinitywallstreet.org/" target="_blank">Trinity Church</a>, and <a href="http://www.frauncestavern.com/" 
				target="_blank"> Fraunces Tavern</a>. This is also the area where you'll find the <a href="http://www.wtc.com/memorial" target="_blank">
				9/11 Memorial Museum</a>.  

				<p><span>Extra</span> <a href="http://www.thebattery.org/" target="_blank">Battery Park</a> has some great 
				views of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, but the boats that take you to those sites are crowded and
				overpriced. I recommend taking a water taxi instead.  

			</article>
				
			<article>	
				
				<img src="images/brooklynbridge.jpg" alt="Brooklyn Bridge">
				
				<h2>Brooklyn Bridge &amp; DUMBO</h2>
				
				<p>If the weather's nice, walk the <a href="http://www.freetoursbyfoot.com/walking-the-brooklyn-bridge/" 
				target="_blank">Brooklyn Bridge</a>. It's a full of gorgeous NYC views, and that will take you to
				<a href="http://www.brooklynbridgepark.org/" target="_blank">Brooklyn Bridge Park</a> and 
				<a href="http://www.nycgo.com/slideshows/must-see-dumbo" target="_blank">Brooklyn's DUMBO neighborhood</a>.

				<p><span>Extra</span> Check out <a href="http://www.mrchocolate.com/" target="_blank">Jacques Torres</a>, a 
				famous French bakery in DUMBO that you will not soon forget. Then, take a <a href="https://www.nywatertaxi.com/"
				target="_blank">New York Water Taxi</a> back to Lower Manhattan and enjoy views of the Statue of Liberty and 
				Manhattan skyline along the way.

				<img src="images/highline.jpg" alt="The High Line">
				
				<h2>The High Line</h2>
				
				<p><a href="http://www.thehighline.org/" target="_blank">The High Line</a> is a public park built on a historic 
				freight rail line elevated above the streets on Manhattanâ€™s West Side. It's part walking trail, part sculpture 
				garden, and a great break from the busy city streets. 
				
				<p><span>Extra</span> Start from the northern side and then explore 
				<a href="http://www.timeout.com/newyork/manhattan/chelsea-manhattan-neighborhood-guide" target="_blank">Chelsea</a> 
				and <a href="http://www.timeout.com/newyork/manhattan/greenwich-village-manhattan-neighborhood-guide" target="_blank">
				Greenwich Village</a> at the end.

				<img src="images/chinatown.jpg" alt="Chinatown">
			
				<h2>China Town</h2>
				
				<p>Check out <a href="http://www.explorechinatown.com/" target="_blank">China Town</a>. It's a treasure 
				trove of authentic Chinese food. From eerily convincing knock offs of high fashion brands to every kind of 
				tchotchke you could possibly imagine, this neighborhood is the perfect place to haggle for gifts and souvenirs.</p>
				
				<p><span>Extra</span> Look for <a href="http://sweets.seriouseats.com/2014/02/a-tour-of-aji-ichiban-the-asian-candy-havens-outpost-in-nyc.html" 
				target="_blank">Aji Ichiban's</a>. It's a Hong Kong-based candy store chain that is packed with all 
				kinds of delicious and exotic sweets.</p>

				<img src="images/broadway.jpg" alt="Broadway Theater District">
			
				<h2>Broadway Theater District</h2>
				
				<p>NYC is home to some of the best theater in the country. If you have the money, go see a 
				<a href="https://www.broadway.org/shows" target="_blank">Broadway show</a>.
				<a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/shows/shows.php?page=oshows" target="_blank">Off-Broadway shows</a> 
				can be very good, too, sometimes so good, they end up on Broadway (Rent, for example).</p>
				
				<p><span>Extra</span> Hang out by the Broadway stage doors, as the actors often come out and greet fans 
				there after a performance.</p>

				<img src="images/amnh.jpg" alt="American Museum of Natural History">
				
				<h2>American Museum of Natural History</h2>
				
				<p>The <a href="http://www.amnh.org/" target="_blank">American Museum of Natural History</a> is home to
				the largest human evolution exhibit in the world as well as the famous 
				<a href="http://www.amnh.org/our-research/hayden-planetarium" target="_blank">Hayden Planetarium</a>, 
				run by Neil deGrasse Tyson.</p>
				
				<p><span>Extra</span> This museum is located in the 
				<a href="http://www.timeout.com/newyork/manhattan/upper-east-side-manhattan-neighborhood-guide" 
				target="_blank">Upper East Side</a>, where lots of celebrities, including Tina Fey, Louis CK, Bono,
				Matt Damon, and Al Pacino. The restaurants in this area are worth every dime. My favorites include 
				<a href="http://www.nicematinnyc.com/" target="_blank">Nice Matin</a> and 
				<a href="http://tessanyc.com/" target="_blank">Tessa.</a></p>

				<img src="images/grandcentral.jpg" alt="Grand Central Station">
				
				<h2>Grand Central</h2>
				
				<p><a href="http://www.grandcentralterminal.com/" target="_blank">Grand Central Station</a> is an architectural beauty, 
				not to mention an iconic NYC stop. The food at Grand Central is worth checking out too. <a href="http://www.oysterbarny.com/" 
				target="_blank">The Oyster Bar</a> is legendary.</p> 
				
				<p><span>Extra</span> You can take day trips in and out of NYC from Grand Central Station. For example, it only takes about 
				an hour to get to New Haven, CT, from Grand Central - home of Yale University and some stellar dining opportunities, like 
				<a href="http://www.clairescornercopia.com/" target="_blank">Claire's Corner Copia</a>.</p>

				<img src="images/tenement.jpg" alt="Tenement Museum">
				
				<h2>Tenement Museum</h2>
				
				<p>The <a href="https://www.tenement.org/about.html" target="_blank">Tenement Museum</a> building was once home to 
				nearly 7,000 working class immigrants during the late 1800s/early 1900s. Today, the museum showcases what life was like
				for those immigrant families. They also provide historical walking tours of the 
				<a href="http://www.timeout.com/newyork/manhattan/lower-east-side-manhattan-neighborhood-guide" target="_blank">Lower East Side</a>.</p> 
				
				<p><span>Extra</span> If you want to splash some more history into your day, check out these Lower East Side bars, modeled 
				after the prohibition-era speakeasies, <a href="http://backroomnyc.com/" target="_blank">The Back Room</a> and 
				<a href="http://www.nitecapnyc.com/#about" target="_blank">Nitecap</a>.</p>

				<img src="images/nyclibrary.jpg" alt="New York Public Library">
				
				<h2>New York Public Library</h2>
				
				<p>The <a href="http://www.nypl.org/" target="_blank">New York Public Library</a> is worth a trip. Not only 
				is it an architectural masterpiece, it's widely regarded as one of best public libraries in the country.</p>
				
				<p><span>Extra</span> It's where the beginning of the first Ghostbusters movie was filmed. It's also home to 
				random memorabilia from great literary figures, including Charles Dickens's letter opener, Truman 
				Capote's cigarette case, and Jack Kerouac's crutches.</p>

				<h2>Rockefeller Center</h2>
				
				<p><a href="https://www.rockefellercenter.com/" target="_blank">Rockefeller Center</a> is the home of NBC Studios.
				It's where Saturday Night Live is filmed, along with a ton of other NBC shows. It's fun to tour and the view from 
				the "Top of the Rock" is great.</p>
				
				<p><span>Extra</span> Every winter, Rockefeller Plaza is turned into that famous ice skating rink that you've seen 
				in so many movies.</p>

			<article>
				
				<img src="images/empirestate.jpg" alt="Empire State Building">
				
				<h2>The Empire State Building</h2>
				
				<p>The <a href="http://www.esbnyc.com/" target="_blank">Empire State Building</a> is a gorgeous 
				example of Art Deco architecture and the roof (or close to the roof) is probably the best nighttime view 
				of NYC.<p>
				
				<p><span>Extra</span> If you have the money, the express experience is way faster and better than being 
				trapped in lines with crowds of tourists for hours.</p>

			</article>
			
			<article>
			
				<img src="images/unitednations.jpg" alt="The United Nations">
			
				<h2>The United Nations</h2>
				
				<p>The <a href="http://visit.un.org/" target="_blank">United Nations</a> is in NYC. The tours are fascinating, 
				partly because of what they do there and partly because of all the beautiful artwork that's been gifted to 
				them from countries all over the world. 
				
				<p><span>Extra</span> Travel light the day you tour and expect some heavy, TSA-style security checks at the 
				entrance.</p>

				<h2>NYC Pizza</h2>
				
				<p>There is NOTHING like a slice of NYC pizza. Pizza joints are cheap and everywhere. Don't miss it! 
				
				<p><span>Extra</span> Here's a couple to check out if you're near: <a href="http://www.davincipizzanewyork.com/" 
				target="_blank">Da Vinci Pizza</a>, <a href="http://www.grimaldispizzeria.com/" target="_blank">Grimaldiâ€™s Pizza</a>,
