				<h2>Travel</h2>
				
				<ul>
				
					<li> If you're staying for more than three or four days, it's easier and ultimately cheaper to just buy
					a seven-day all-you-can-ride <a href="http://web.mta.info/metrocard/" target="_blank">MetroCard</a>.</li>
					
					<li> Beware of the subway's MetroCard readers...They sometimes misread cards and then don't allow you to 
					try again for something like 10-15 minutes. It's supposed to stop people from swiping in a whole group on 
					one card, but it sucks when it happens to you by accident.</li>
					
					<li> Beware of the Express subway trains. These trains don't stop at every stop on the weekends and during 
					rush hour. If you're not paying attention, it could turn your short trip into an unexpected visit to 
					Brooklyn or Harlem or somewhere much farther away than you planned. The good news about that though is that,
					nine times out of ten, you can just walk to other side of the stop and get back on in the opposite direction.</li>
					
					<li> When you're looking at maps of Manhattan, keep in mind that one city block is often equal to about 3 
					city blocks in a typical city. You're going to be walking A LOT, so - for the love of God - wear comfortable
					shoes and pack some blister protection.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Safety</h2>
				
				<ul>
					
					<li>Watch your back in the subway. Phone theft is a biggie there, especially if you're visibly not aware of your 
					surroundings. I usually wait to check my phone until I'm in the subway car, where it is then a great way to avoid 
					talking to the weirdos.</li>
					
					<li>If it’s late, it’s best to cab it back to your hotel rather than waiting in a subway station where there are 
					few to no other people. That’s a great way to get yourself mugged or worse. </li>
					
					<li>One failsafe is to carry your driver's license and between $30-50 hidden on your person (somewhere other than 
					your wallet, like a sock). That way, if you do get mugged, you've still got a way to get back to where you're staying
					and an ID to get on the plane home.</li>
					
					<li>If you explore the boroughs (like Brooklyn, Queens, etc.), be aware that these neighborhoods tend to be a real 
					mix of rough and gentrified and they often are a little dicier than Manhattan.</li>
